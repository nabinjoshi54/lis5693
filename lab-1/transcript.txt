I’m going to ask you
to participate in an experiment,
which is that when you leave this room,
when you go out into the world,
today, tomorrow,
or whenever you feel like it,
I’d like you to ask and answer
one question of someone who’s a stranger.
You might meet them on the bus
or walking down the street.
I’m going to show you the question
I’m going to ask you to ask and answer.
The question is,
“When was the last time
you cried in front of someone?”
Now, just out of curiosity,
how many of you are really excited
about this experiment?
No hands went up whatsoever.
And that makes sense, right?
Because there can be nothing
that seems more intimidating or less fun
than finding a stranger, asking them when
they’ve cried in front of someone else,
and then telling them about the time
you cried in front of someone else.
But I’m going to try and convince you
that this experiment
is not only worth doing,
it’s worth doing whenever you can,
because it will make your life better.
To explain how I got to this,
I’ve to tell you a little bit of a story
about me and my wife.
A few years ago,
we got into this bad pattern.
We’d been married for 20 years, but I’d
come home from a long day at the office,
I was a reporter
at the New York Times at that point,
and I’d start complaining about my day,
about how I’m not appreciated enough.
And my wife, very reasonably,
would offer me some great advice.
Like, “Why don’t you take
your boss out to lunch?
You guys can get to know
each other better.”
And instead of being able to hear her,
I would get even more upset.
And I would say things like,
“Why aren’t you supporting me?
You should be outraged on my behalf.”
And she would get upset
because I was attacking her
for giving me good advice.
This was not...
Anyone ever had an experience like this?
It was not a good situation.
And so, I started talking to researchers
who were studying communication.
I asked them, “Why am I
getting into this pattern?”
They said, “Well,
you’re making a mistake.”
We’re living through this golden age
of understanding communication,
really for the first time,
because of advances
in neural imaging and data collection.
They said one of the big things
that we’ve learned
Is that we tend to think of a discussion
as being just one conversation.
We’re talking about one thing:
my day, or the kids’ grades,
or what to have for dinner.
But what they said is that actually,
each discussion contains
many different conversations.
In general, these conversations 
tend to fall into one of three buckets.
There’s these practical conversations,
where we’re talking about
what this is all about,
what we’re really discussing.
But then there’s emotional conversations,
where we’re talking about how we feel,
and my goal is
to share with you my feelings,
and I don’t want you to solve them,
I want you to empathize.
And then there’s social conversations
about who we are, the social identities
that are important to us,
how we relate
to each other and to society.
And what the researchers said
is that we’ve learned
if people are having different
conversations at the same moment,
they can’t really hear each other.
They can’t really connect.
And this is exactly what was happening
with me and my wife, right?
I was coming home and having
an emotional conversation.
My wife was responding
with a practical conversation.
They are both legitimate conversations,
but because we weren’t having
the same conversation at the same moment,
we weren’t really communicating
with each other.
And within neurology and psychology,
this insight has become so important
that it’s become known
as the matching principle,
which says that successful communication
requires recognizing what kind
of conversation is occurring
and then matching each other.
But how do we do that?
Well, in schools, they’ve actually
 taught teachers to do this.
If you are a school teacher, 
you’ll probably learn at some point
that If a student comes to you
with a problem or something to talk about,
you should ask them,
“Do you want to be helped?”
which is a practical conversation.
“Do you want to be hugged?” which is
an emotional conversation.
Or “Do you want to be heard?”
which is a social conversation.
And it seems to work.
It seems like if you ask students
what they need,
they’ll tell you.
But of course, that is hard to do
in real life, right?
If you go up and ask someone at work
if they want a hug,
the HR might get involved,
so you might not want to do that.
But luckily, there is another way
of doing this for all of us normal people,
which is to ask questions
and in particular,
to ask a certain type of question,
a special question
known as a deep question.
A deep question is something
that invites us to talk about our values
or our beliefs or our experiences.
And that can sound a little intimidating,
but it’s actually
much easier than it sounds.
For instance, instead of asking someone,
“Where do you work?”
you could ask them,
“What do you love about your job?”
Instead of asking someone,
“Where did you go to high school?”
you could say, “What was high school like?
What did you learn there?
What changed you there?”
Put differently, instead of asking
about the facts of someone’s life,
we should ask them
how they feel about their life.
Because when we do, they tend
to reveal to us who they really are.
They tend to tell us what they want,
not only out of this conversation,
but how they hope that we’ll see them
and how they want to see us,
what matters to them most.
In fact, what studies show us
is that this is so powerful
because these kinds of questions
allow us to be vulnerable,
and vulnerability
and reciprocal vulnerability,
when we hear vulnerability
and we become vulnerable in return,
is the key to allowing us
to connect with other people.
To explain how this works,
I want to tell you a story
about this guy, Doctor Behfar Ehdaie.
Dr. Ehdaie is a cancer surgeon
in New York City.
He specializes in prostate cancer,
removing prostate tumors...
Removing cancer tumors from prostates.
And he has this kind of interesting job,
because every single day
a patient will come into his office
asking, he thinks, for medical advice,
and what he will tell them is,
“You should not get surgery.”
The prostate is located so close
to the to the nerves that control
urination and sexual function
that it’s a relatively risky surgery.
And what's more, most prostate tumors,
they grow very, very slowly.
It’s actually one of the slowest growing
forms of cancer in existence.
There’s a saying among doctors
that if you have an old patient
with prostate cancer,
he’s going to die of old age
before the cancer kills him.
And so Dr. Ehdaie would’ve
these patients come in and he’d tell them,
“Look, I don’t think
you should do anything.
I think you should do active surveillance.
What we’re going to do is 
take a blood sample every 6 months,
we’re going to do a biopsy every 2 years,
and if the tumor seems to change,
we’ll do an MRI,
 and if we’ve to, we can do the surgery,
but otherwise, no radiation, no surgery,
it’s going to be okay.”
And these patients would listen to him,
and then they’d go home
and they’d discuss it with their spouse,
and then they’d walk in the next day
and they’d insist on having the surgery.
They’d say, “I want you to cut me open,
take the tumor out as fast as possible.”
And for Dr. Ehdaie,
this was bewildering, right?
He thought these would be
the easiest conversations of his life.
He’s telling people that they don’t
have to have surgery, and he’s a surgeon.
He told me that when this happens
again and again and again,
you start to realize this isn’t
a problem with my patients.
This is a problem with me.
I’m doing something wrong.
And so he goes to these professors
at the Harvard Business School,
and he asks them for advice
on what to do differently.
And they said, “Well look,
your biggest mistake
 is you are starting
this conversation all wrong.
You are starting by assuming that
the patient walks into your exam room
looking for advice
and looking for medical solutions.
But you don’t know if that’s true,
you’re not asking them any questions.
What you need to do is
you need to start asking deep questions.”
So two weeks later,
after having this conversation,
a 62-year-old man comes into 
Dr. Ehdaie’s office for the first time.
He had just gotten his diagnosis
of having prostate cancer.
And Dr Ehdaie,
instead of giving him advice,
instead of telling him what to do,
he asks the question,
“What does this cancer 
diagnosis mean to you?”
And the man starts talking.
And he starts talking about how his father
had died when he was 17 years old.
And this had just been so hard for him,
and it had been so hard for his mom.
And then he starts talking about
how at work he’s worried
that the younger employees,
if they find out that he has cancer,
they’ll look at him differently.
They’re going to be
already writing him into the grave,
even though he’s got
20 or 30 years left on his career.
And then he starts talking
about his grandchildren
and his fears for the world
they’re inheriting,
with climate change
and everything else that’s going on.
Dr. Ehdaie had expected this guy
to at least bring up cancer,
to at least mention mortality or pain,
but it never came up.
And at that moment, Dr. Ehdaie realized,
because he had asked this deep question,
that this man wanted to have
an emotional conversation.
He wanted to talk about how do we feel.
He needed to be hugged.
So Dr. Ehdaie didn’t actually hug him,
but he did the verbal equivalent.
He started talking about how he understood
that his own father had gotten sick
and that it had been terrifying for them,
but it had also brought them together
 in these ways
that he didn’t actually anticipate.
And they talk about this
for eight minutes, just eight minutes.
And then Dr. Ehdaie says,
“Look, do you mind?
There’s some medical options
I’d like to talk over with you.
 Is that okay?”
And they move into
a practical conversation together.
And within seven more minutes,
the man decides to do active surveillance
and never looks back.
Dr. Ehdaie’s patients overwhelmingly
now opt for active surveillance,
his advice, because of this approach.
And the thing is, we can do
this in any conversation.
It doesn’t have to be an
important conversation or life or death.
We can always connect more and better,
and in a really profound way,
with the person that we’re speaking to,
if we want to.
Which brings me back to that experiment.
So just to remind you
what you’re supposed to do:
walk out of the room, find a stranger,
ask them, “When was the last time
you cried in front of someone?”
And then as soon as they answer,
you answer the question yourself,
and you tell them when you last cried.
Let me just say, this experiment
has been done thousands of times,
most notably by a guy named Nick Epley
at the University of Chicago.
People hate this experiment.
Nobody who participates
comes in and is like,
“I’m really looking...
This is going to be a great time.”
Instead, what they say is,
“I do not want to do this.
This sounds terrible.”
But they’re in an experiment
and they basically have to do it.
They get paired with a partner,
they go and ask the question,
ask and answer,
and then Nick Epley afterwards asks them,
“What was that like?”
And what people say are things like,
 “Oh, my gosh,
I felt so connected to that person,
more connected than I’ve been to people
in other conversations in a while.
 I felt more caring towards them,
and I felt like they were
really caring about me.
I felt like they listened so attentively,
and it was really easy for me
to listen to what they were saying.”
Ultimately, almost everyone says this is
one of the best conversations
that they’ve had in the last week,
the last month, the last year...
And they say things like, “I’m so glad
I got paired with that person,
because they were exactly right for me.”
When in truth,
the only thing that was right
is that they were a stranger
and they had the right question,
the right kind of question to ask.
So why? Why is this so powerful?
Why is asking this question,
why does it help us connect so well?
Because it’s a deep question.
It allows us to say something real.
And when we ask deep questions,
we figure out which
of the three conversations we’re in,
what we’re talking about,
what everyone really wants
out of this dialogue.
And that is how
we connect with each other.
We are living through a time
of polarization and division.
We have forgotten
how to have conversations.
But there's a science to it.
There are these folks
who are known as super communicators,
who are not special,
they’re not more charismatic,
or they’re not more outgoing
than anyone else.
They’ve just learned skills
that allow us to connect with others.
And they’re skills
that all of us can learn.
And that feeling you get
after a wonderful conversation,
that glow that you experience,
our brains have evolved to give us that,
to crave connection.
So I hope you go out,
I hope you find a stranger,
and I hope you tell them all about
the last time you cried
in front of another person.
And then tell me how it went.
Thanks.
